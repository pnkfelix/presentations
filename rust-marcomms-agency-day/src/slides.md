## What {.center}

Rust: new systems programming language

. . .

Mozilla: building new high-perf. browser technology atop Rust

Servo: Browser research platform

# Background {.center}

## Systems

Systems Programmers make:

 * Browsers

 * Operating Systems

 * Game Engines

 * Mobile Apps

Willing to invest great effort to optimize
resource usage (e.g. low memory overhead),
and runtime performance.

## Programming Languages { data-transition="fade-out" .left_align }

So many to choose from

Actionscript, C, C#, C++, Clojure, Fortran, Go, Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Visual Basic, ...

## Programming Languages { data-transition="fade-in" .left_align }

So many to choose from

~~Actionscript~~, C, C#, C++, Clojure, Fortran, Go, Java, ~~Javascript~~, ~~Python~~, ~~Ruby~~,  ~~Visual Basic~~, ...

Most not suitable for *systems development* ...

 * hard-to-predict or poor performance

 *

## Programming Languages { data-transition="fade-in" .left_align }

~~So many to choose from~~

~~Actionscript~~, C, ~~C#~~, C++, ~~Clojure~~, Fortran, ~~Go~~, ~~Java~~, ~~Javascript~~, ~~Python~~, ~~Ruby~~, ~~Visual Basic~~, ...

Most not suitable for *systems development* ...

 * hard-to-predict or poor performance

 * reliance on hard-to-manage runtime machinery e.g. "garbage collection" or atomic ref-counting

. . .

... but the languages remaining are *unsafe* ...

 * bugs might crash application, corrupt data, exposure to "pwnage"

. . .

... and complicate utilization of available (multicore) parallelism.

## { .left_align }

Example systems code: direct access to bytes in memory

``` {.rust}
buffer = new String("Hello");  interior = &buffer[2..];  assert_eq!(interior[0], 'l');
```

```art
     .-------------.
buf: | String      |
     | ----------- |
     |     data: --+----.
     | ----------- |    |
     |   length: 4 |    |
     | ----------- |    |  .-----------------------------------------------.
     | capacity: 8 |    '->| 'H' | 'e' | 'l' | 'l' | 'o' |     |     |     |
     '-------------'       '-----------------------------------------------'
                                          ^
                                          |
interior: --------------------------------'
```

. . .

``` {.rust}
buffer.append(" all!"); // adds five more bytes
```

. . .

```art
     .-------------.
buf: | String      |
     | ----------- |     .-------------------------------------------------------------------.
     |     data: --+---> | 'H' | 'e' | 'l' | 'l' | 'o' | ' ' | 'a' | 'l' | 'l' | '!' |   |   |
     | ----------- |     '-------------------------------------------------------------------'
     |   length: 4 |
     | ----------- |     .-----------------------------------------------.
     | capacity:12 |     | 'H' | 'e' | 'l' | 'l' | 'o' |     |     |     |
     '-------------'     '-----------------------------------------------'
                                        ^  [deleted]
                                        |
interior: --=-=-=-----------------------'   <-- dangling reference!
[deleted]: style="stroke-dasharray: 5,2;"
```

. . .

``` {.rust}
assert_eq!(interior[0], ðŸ’£); // ðŸ˜±
```

## Enter Rust

Objective: Prevent all bugs of this nature

. . .

If your Rust code compiles, it does not have:

 * dangling references

 * buffer overflows

 * crashes (segmentation faults)

 * remote code execution vulnerabilities

 * data race conditions (*big* win for parallel systems)

. . .

No popular systems language offers all of above properties

(only ones from research labs)

## Why Mozilla Invests

>- Hard to prototype changes atop C++ code base
>- Rust â‡’ Servo, platform for browswer implementation research
>- Servo â‡’ Parallel CSS matching, WebRender (web content atop GPU)
>- Want Rust for next-gen infrastructure (services, IoT)

. . .

Mozilla's mission statement

> "Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."

## Open and Accessible to All

Original audience was systems programmers: C/C++, focus on enabling interoperation between Rust and C

. . .

But: also have attention from elsewhere

![From 2016 Survey](what_language.png)

Of 1987 Rust users surveyed, 732 left C and C++ unchecked

### Enabling systems programming for those without such experience!

## Open Source, Open Community

Rust has been *open source* since the beginning

Open governance model based on *public RFCs*

We have an *active, amazing community*

## Community

We have had a code of conduct from the outset,
stressing inclusiveness (and clarifying what that means when
necessary).

> The Rust community seems to be populated entirely by human beings. I
>  have no idea how this was done. I suspect Graydon Hoare deserves a
>  large share of the credit for leading by example but everyone I have
>  interacted with in the community has been friendly and patient.

We still need help improving diversity, though; see [2016 survey].

## Projects are pivoting to Rust {.center}

* [Skylight][] swapped Rust for Ruby back in 2014

* [Maidsafe][] went from C++ to Rust in 2015

* Dropbox moved [Diskotech][] from Go to Rust in 2016
 
  * and ported [Broti][] compression from C to Rust too

* [Friends of Rust][]: organizations using Rust in production

[Friends of Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html

## How to "sell" Rust?

* If you are, or know, a C/C++ programmer

* tired of debugging crashes and/or multithreaded programs

You might want to try Rust

. . .

* If you are, or know, a "high-level programmer" (Javascript, Ruby)

* but you want to expand your mind/skill-set

You might want to try Rust

## What's Next

Firefox 48 had the first bits of Rust (media parser)

### Browser Technology

 * Servo marches on (e.g WebRender 2)

 * Incremental integration with Gecko (Stylo); want "best of both worlds"

To learn more, contact the Servo team, especially `@pcwalton`

Or try out Servo yourself! https://blog.servo.org/2016/06/30/servo-nightlies/

### Rust itself

Still establishing vision for 2017; [discussion link][2017 vision discuss]

[2017 vision discuss]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/setting-our-vision-for-the-2017-cycle/

Initial proposals:

 * Lower learning curve

 * Faster compiler

 * IDE support

 * Advanced abstractions for concurrency and parallelism

 * More seamless FFI
