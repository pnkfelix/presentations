# Final Words

<!--
## Interop

* Rust to C

  * <div class="fragment">easy: `extern { ... }` and `unsafe { ... }`</div>

* C to Rust

  * <div class="fragment">easy: `#[no_mangle] extern "C" fn foo(...) { ... }`</div>

* Ruby, Python, etc to Rust

  * <div class="fragment">see e.g. `https://github.com/wycats/rust-bridge`</div>

## So much more!

Touched on things like `Send` and `Sync`, but there is more to Rust's
secret sauce

>- Lifetimes

>- Object-orientation via trait-references

>- Unboxed closures

. . .

Lots of technology (and still evolving!)
