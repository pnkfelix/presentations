Let's buy a car

let money: Money = bank.withdraw_cash();
let my_new_car: Car = dealership.buy_car(money);
```

``` {.rust .compile_error}
let second_car = dealership.buy_car(money); // <-- cannot reuse
```

money transferred into `dealership`,
and car transferred to us.

## Correction: Ownership is intuitive, except for programmers ...  { .center }

### ... and anyone else who *names* things

## Ãœber Sinn und Bedeutung

("On sense and reference" -- Gottlob Frege, 1892)

If ownership were all we had, car-purchase slide seems nonsensical

``` {.rust}
my_new_car.drive_to(home);
```

. . .

Does this transfer `home` into the car?

Do I lose access to my home, just because I drive to it?

. . .

We must distinguish an object itself from ways to name that object

 * Above, `home` cannot be (an owned) `Home`

 * `home` must instead be some kind of *reference* to a `Home`

## So we will need references {.center}

## a truth: Ownership *is* important {.center}

## Ownership is important

Ownership enables:       which removes:
----------------------   -------------------------------------------
RAII-style destructors   a source of memory leaks (or fd leaks, etc)
no dangling pointers     many resource management bugs
no data races            many multithreading heisenbugs
----------------------   -------------------------------------------

Good developers ask this already!

Rust forces function signatures to encode the answers

(and they are checked by the compiler)

<div class="notes">
Its worth pointing out that the encoded answer can
include "I leave it up to the caller to decide";
that is what `Cow<'a, T>` is for.
