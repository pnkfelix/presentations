## Data {.center}

Since Rust's first birthday:

>- 10,800 commits by 663 contributors

>- 56 RFCs merged

>- 4,405 new crates published

>- 48 new companies running Rust in production

>- Four conferences so far this year (lots of online video) ...

>- ... three more conferences still to come: RustConf 2017 (Portland OR, USA), RustFest Fall 2017 (Zurich, Switzerland), Rust Belt Rust 2017 (Columbus OH, USA)

* (for other stats see blog post)

## Production Use

>- Rust in production: <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/friends.html">Friends of Rust</a>; <a href="http://rustjobs.rs">`rustjobs.rs`</a>
>- Dropbox: Magic Pocket (see Wired article); Rust in Windows desktop client (see also `@jamwt` air mozilla talk)
>- Mozilla: Servo nightlies; Oxidation initiated w/ Firefox 48; Project Quantum
>- GNOME: from experiments in October 2016 to hackfest in March 2017
>- npm: Using Rust to serve JS packages (see `@ag_dubs` talk at RustFest Spring 2017)

## Roadmap  {.center}

Goals for 2017:

 * **Lower learning curve**
 
 * **Pleasant edit-compile-debug cycle**
 
 * Basic but solid IDE experience

 * High quality crates and crate accessibility

 * Support writing robust, high-scale servers

 * Integrate into large build systems

 * **Provide community-based mentoring at all levels**

## Lower Learning Curve {.center}

* Language Ergonomics Initiative

* 2nd ed of "The Book"

>- `match` and ownership ergonomics
>- non-lexical lifetimes
>- lifetime elision improvements
>- and many more ideas in flight!

## Edit-Compile-Debug Cycle  {.center}

>- Incremental compilation; try it out on Nightly with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 cargo <command>`
>- Improved full compilation times; better by 5-10% on average
>- <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/">`perf.rust-lang.org`</a>

## Mentoring at all levels  {.center}

>- RustBridge for getting started with Rust
>- Interns via Outreachy and GSoC
>- Identification of low-committment, high-impact tasks; e.g. improved error messages
>- Language Team Shepherds
>- Growth of number and size of subteams; more opportunities to step into leadership roles

## Happy 2nd Birthday Rust {.center}
