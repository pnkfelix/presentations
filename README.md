pnkfelix/presentations
=========================

Source for slideshow presentations, mostly of Rust, at various conferences.

The source for particular presentations tends to be held in individual branches.

The *deployed* presentations are all collected together on the
`gh-pages` branch.

The index is hosted, at least in principle, at:
http://pnkfelix.github.io/presentations/
